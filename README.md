### This is a application for module challenge 9. I worked on this application with the help of my tutor, my team and was doing practicing through the recording. Name of my application is Readme.Generator. Through this application user can dynamically create a good readme.md in a very less time and in very efficient way.Asked question if user can put the name of the repo, User can explain why this is so important, User can explain the description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions through this application. User can choose the license which is used in the Repository. I have used JavaScript, node.js and npm in this challenge. This challenge was full of fun, I played with this challenge while putting different questions and generating it in the Readme.md
